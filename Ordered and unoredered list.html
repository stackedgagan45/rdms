    <h1>Relational Data Model</h1>
    <section>The relational model in DBMS is an abstract model used
        to organize and manage the data stored in a database.
        It stores data in two-dimensional inter-related tables,
        also known as relations in which each row represents an
        entity and each column represents the properties of the entity.
        <ul>The relational model is composed of 3 fundamental concepts:</ul>


        <li>Tuple: Row of the relation, depicting a real-world entity.</li>
        <ul>A tuple is a row of a relation.</ul>
        <li>Attribute: Column of the relation, depicting the properties of the entity.</li>
        <li>Relation: Table of the relation, depicting the relations of the entity.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Relation: Collection of tuples.</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>Attribute: Property of the entity.</ul>

        <ol> Properties of Relational Data Model:
            <li>A Relation is a collection of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).</li>
            <li>Relational keys are used to uniquely identify a row in a table or to determine the 
                &nbsp;relationship&nbsp; between two tables.</li>
