    <h1>Relational Data Model</h1>
    <section>The relational model in DBMS is an abstract model used
        to organize and manage the data stored in a database.
        It stores data in two-dimensional inter-related tables,
        also known as relations in which each row represents an
        entity and each column represents the properties of the entity.
        <ul>The relational model is composed of 3 fundamental concepts:</ul>


        <li>Tuple: Row of the relation, depicting a real-world entity.</li>
        <ul>A tuple is a row of a relation.</ul>
        <li>Attribute: Column of the relation, depicting the properties of the entity.</li>
        <li>Relation: Table of the relation, depicting the relations of the entity.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Relation: Collection of tuples.</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>Attribute: Property of the entity.</ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <ol> Properties of Relational Data Model:
            <li>A Relation is a collection of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).</li>
            <li>Relational keys are used to uniquely identify a row in a table or to determine the
                &nbsp;relationship&nbsp; between two tables.</li>
        </ol>

    <h1 class="data"> What is data structure?</h1>
    <p>A data structure is a format for organizing, processing,
        retrieving and storing data so it can be easily accessed and effectively used.</p>

    <p>Linear Data Structure: Array, List, Vector, Stack, Queue.</p>
    <p>Non Linear Data Structure: Tree, Graph.</p>


    <div id="Linear">
        <p class="linear_datastructure" >A linear data structure is a structure in which the elements
            are stored sequentially, and the elements are connected to the previous and the next element.
            As the elements are stored sequentially,
            so they can be traversed or accessed in a single run.</p>
