    <h1>What is 'C' Language?</h1><br>
    <section> Why 'C'?
        <article> C programming language uses blocks to separate pieces of code performing
            different tasks. This helps make programming easier and keeps the code clean.
            Thus, the code is easy to understand even for those who are starting out.
            C is used in embedded programming, which is used to control micro-controllers.
